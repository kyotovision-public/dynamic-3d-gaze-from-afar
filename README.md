## Prerequisites

We tested our code with Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Our code depends on the following modules.
* numpy
* opencv_python
* matplotlib
* tqdm
* pytorch
* torchvision
* pytorch_lightning
* efficientnet_pytorch
* albumentations

Please browse [`conda.yaml`](conda.yaml) to find the specific versions we used in our test environment, or you can simply do
```
$ conda env create --file conda.yaml
```
in your (virtual) environment.

Alternatively, you can use [`gafa.def`](singularity/gafa.def) to build your [`singularity`](https://sylabs.io/) container by
```
$ singularity build --fakeroot ./singularity/gafa.sif ./singularity/gafa.def
INFO:    Starting build...
Getting image source signatures
(snip)
INFO:    Creating SIF file...
INFO:    Build complete: ./gafa.sif
```
The file size of the generated container file (`gafa.sif` in this example) will be around 7.7GB.

### Raw data

We provide the raw surveillance videos, calibration data (camera intrinsics and extrainsics), and annotation data (gaze/head/body directions). Our dataset contains 5 daily scenes, *lab, library, kitchen, courtyard, and living room*.

The data is organized as follows.

```
data/raw_data
├── library/
│   ├──1026_3/
│   │   ├── Camera1_0/
│   │   │   ├── 000000.jpg
│   │   │   ├── 000001.jpg
│   │   │    ...
│   │   ├── Camera1_0.pkl
│   │    ...
│   │   ├── Camera1_1/
│   │   ├── Camera1_1.pkl
│   │    ...
│   │   ├── Camera2_0/
│   │   ├── Camera2_0.pkl
│   │    ...
│   ├──1028_2/
│   ...
├── lab/
├── courtyard/
├── living_room/
├── kitchen/
└── intrinsics.npz
```

Data is stored in five scenes (e.g. `library/`).
- Each scene is subdivided by shooting session (e.g. `1026_3/`).
- Each session is stored frame by frame with images taken from each camera (e.g. `Camera1_0, Camera2_0, ..., Caemra8_0`).
   - For example, `Camera1_0/000000.jpg` and `Camera2_0/000000.jpg` contain images of a person as seen from each camera at the same time.
   - In some cases, we further divided the session into multiple subsessions (e.g. `Camera1_1, Camera1_2, ...`).
- The calibration data of each camera and annotation data (gaze, head, and body directions) in the camera coordinate are stored in a pickle file (e.g. `Caera1_0.pkl`).
- The cameras share a single intrinsic parameter given in [`intrinsics.npz`](data/raw_data/intrinsics.npz).


### Preprocessed data

The preprocessed data are stored in a similar format as the raw data, but each frame contains cropped person images.

We also provide a script to preprocess raw data as [data/preprocessed/preprocess.py](data/preprocessed/preprocess.py).


## Usage

### Demo

Please open the following Jupyter notebooks.
* [`demo.ipynb`](demo.ipynb): Demo code for end-to-end gaze estimation with our proposed model.
* [`dataset-demo.ipynb`](./data/dataset-demo.ipynb): Demo code to visualize annotations of the GAFA dataset.

In case you have built your singularity container as mentioned above, you can launch `jupyter` in `singularity` by
```
$ singularity exec ./singularity/gafa.sif jupyter notebook --port 12345
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:/// ...
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:12345/?token= ...
     or http://127.0.0.1:12345/?token= ...
```

Or, you can launch bash shell in `singularity` by
```
singularity shell --nv ./singularity/gafa.sif --port 12345
```

### Evaluation with the GAFA dataset

Please download the weights of the pretrained models from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oJVaaNoMo9_qoo7q1z1ek1y-gjXwy55O/view?usp=sharing), and place the `.pth` files to `models/weights`.

We can then evaluate the accuracy of the estimated gaze direction with our model.
```
python eval.py \
   --gpus 1 (If no GPU is available, set -1)

# Result
MAE (3D front):  20.697409
MAE (2D front):  17.393957
MAE (3D back):  23.210892
MAE (2D back):  21.901659
MAE (3D all):  21.688675
MAE (2D all):  20.889896
```

### Training with the GAFA dataset

You can train our model with the GAFA dataset by
```
python train.py \
   --epoch 10 \
   --n_frames 7 \
   --gpus 2
```

It will consume 24GB for each GPUs, and takes about 24 hours for training. As we implement our model using `distributed data parallel` functionality in PyTorch Lightning, you can speed up the training by adding more GPUs.

If your GPU's VRAM is less than 24 GB, please switch the model to `data parallel` mode by changing `strategy="ddp"` in `train.py` to `strategy="dp"`.
